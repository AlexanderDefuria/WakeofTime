# Wake of Time

Wake of Time is a simple game engine written in C++ to create two dimensional games with a top down or 3/4 view.

The engine works by interpreting files to setup the world. This is a relatively simple approach that can be easily utilized by a world editor as it can edit the files instead of doing it manually. It is designed to be cross platform using no tools that are platform specific so that games can be created on a variety of platforms without reprogramming anything. 

This engine is being created as a learning experience to gain an introduction to the fundamentels of game programming in the modern era.
